Hello!
My name is Sonal, and I’m a part of the BoilerMake Hackathon board at Purdue University! We’re thrilled to announce that BoilerMake 2026 is right around the corner, and we would love for your students to be a part of it. BoilerMake is one of the biggest collegiate hackathons in the Midwest, bringing together over 500 students from numerous universities and majors for 36 hours of hacking.
This year, BoilerMake will be held from January 23-25 on Purdue’s West Lafayette campus. Applications are now open, and we would appreciate your help in spreading the word to your students. Participation is completely free, and we will be providing meals, swag, and an incredible experience! 
Please email us at team@boilermake.org or DM us on Instagram @boilermake if you have any questions.
Hack On,
Sonal Narasimha
